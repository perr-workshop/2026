    <h2>6th Workshop on Program Equivalence and Relational Reasoning</h2>

    <!--<p style="color: #a11b12;">Submission Deadline Extension till 4 June 2022.</p>-->
    
    <p>PERR is an annual international workshop dedicated to the formal verification of program equivalence and related relational problems. It is the 5th in a series of meetings that bring together researchers from different areas interested in equivalence and related questions. PERR 2022 will be a workshop at <a href="https://www.floc26.org/">FLOC 2026</a>, and a satellite event to <a href="https://conferences.i-cav.org/2026/">CAV 2026</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Program equivalence is arguably one of the most interesting and at the same time important problems in formal verification. It is a cross-cutting topic that has attracted the interest of several research communities: the field of denotational (game) semantics, deductive software verification, bounded model checking, specification inference, software evolution and regression testing, etc.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The goal of the workshop is to bring researchers of the different fields in touch and to stipulate an exchange of ideas leading to forging a community working on PERR. It welcomes contributions from the topics mentioned above but is also open to new questions regarding program equivalence. This includes related research areas of relational reasoning like program refinement or the verification of hyperproperties, in particular of secure information flow.
